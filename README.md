# okcoders-fall17-exaptive-project

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App as part of the Fall 2017 Intermediate Front End class with OKCoders.

The project was provided by Exaptive, a software platform to help people build data apps.

What we built is essentially a documentation page to give a high-level view of Exaptive's standard set of components and Xaps.
