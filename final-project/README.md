This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as part of the Fall 2017 Intermediate Front End class with [OKCoders](http://okcoders.com/). 

The project was provided by [Exaptive](https://www.exaptive.com/), a software platform to help people build data apps. 

What we built is essentially a documentation page to give a high-level view of Exaptive's standard set of components and Xaps.
